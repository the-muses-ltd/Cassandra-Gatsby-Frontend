## 🚀 Quick start

## Setting up for your Local Development

1.  **Download the repository.**

    Download our repo from this github page.

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

  Gatsby Frontend
</h1>

We use Gatsby.js for a a few reasons. 
1. It's built for performance, so we get optimal load speeds.
2. Static pages require less data to be used by our learners, meaning it's more accessable.
3. We love new and cutting edge stacks!

  Prisma GraphQL Backend

Using a GraphQL database not only allows us to further reduce the cost of accessing data to our students, but has future proofed our data to be used by other non-profit organisations.
