# Cassandra Open Education

A platform to distribute educational resources online, which will be freely available to anyone. The aim is to facilitate equal access to education for all.

# Cassandra Architecture
## Where does this application fit into the Cassandra Architecture?
We have multiple applications running behind the scenes to drive the Cassandra project. The Gatsby frontend generates all of our resources for students to access the thousands of resources we store on the Cassandra Database. This is everyone point of open acess to everything we work so hard on at the Cassandra project.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

## Setting up for your Local Development

1.  **Download the repository.**

    Download our repo from this github page.

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

  Gatsby Frontend
</h1>

We use Gatsby.js for a a few reasons: 
1. It's built for performance, so we get optimal load speeds.
2. Static pages require less data to be used by our learners, meaning it's more accessable.
3. We love new and cutting edge stacks!

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to their documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

  Prisma GraphQL Backend

Using a GraphQL database not only allows us to further reduce the cost of accessing data to our students, but has future proofed our data to be used by other non-profit organisations.
